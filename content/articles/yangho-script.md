YanghoScript is a simple programming language with the ability to work with variables, arithmetic operations and display results. Was built for Vietnamese gangstersðŸ˜Ž.

## Features

### Existing Features:

-   Assignment of values to variables
-   Arithmetic operations
-   Outputting results
-   Comment out a line of code

### Upcoming Features (Not Really Soon):

-   Conditional statements
-   Looping constructs
-   Functions
-   Error handling

## Installation

To get started with YanghoScript, you'll need Node.js. Download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hoachnt/YanghoScript.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
cd YanghoScript
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use YanghoScript to execute programs written in this language. Open the `code.ys` file and write your YanghoScript code in it.

Example code:

```javascript
// Assigning a string value to the variable text
text = 'Hoach';
// Assigning the result of addition of numbers to the variable summ
summ = 6 + 5;

// Output the contents of variables to the screen
NOILIENTUC text;
NOILIENTUC summ;

// Assigning the result of an expression to the variable sumandmin
sumandmin = summ - ((20 + 2) * 2);

// Output the result of the expression and a string to the screen
NOILIENTUC sumandmin;
NOILIENTUC 'Chao ca lo nha minh nha';

// True/False operations
NOILIENTUC 1 EQUAL 1;
NOILIENTUC 2 MORE THAN 1;
NOILIENTUC 1 LESS THAN 2;
```

Don't forget that YanhoScript is a joke programming language.
